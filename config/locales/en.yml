# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          - This privacy notice sets out the standards that you can expect from the MoJ and HMCTS when we process personal information (‘personal data’) about you in the context of employment tribunal proceedings; how you can get access to a copy of your personal data; and what you can do if you think the standards are not being met.
          - HMCTS is an Executive Agency of the MoJ. MoJ is the data controller for the personal data held, although it may act jointly with HMCTS. HMCTS also collects and processes personal data for the exercise of its own and associated public functions and legal obligations.
          - This privacy notice does not apply to the processing of personal data which is collected and controlled by the tribunal and its judges when they are acting in their judicial capacity. The judiciary are independent from MoJ and HMCTS and data protection law applies differently to them as a result. For more information, see %{purpose_content_href}
