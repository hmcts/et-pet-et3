RSpec.feature "Check PDF Download Link", js: true do

  # Upon ET3 submission to API, the API generates a PDF version of the ET3 form it just received.
  # In the API's response to ET3's submission, it returns a URL for this PDF. However, due to
  # the asynchronous nature of the PDF generation and API response, the file may not be ready
  # by the time an ET3 user sees the form submission page.
  #
  # As such, upon the form submission page loading, ET3 has a javascript function which checks
  # whether the PDF link is valid. If it is invalid, it disables the link and changes the text
  # displayed to the user. It will then check the link every 10 seconds until the link is
  # valid.
  #
  # This spec test this functionality, therefore it uses a special stub which returns a pdf
  # URL of '/test/pdf-download'. This utilises the controller below to return an invalid
  # link the first time of asking and a valid one thereafter.
